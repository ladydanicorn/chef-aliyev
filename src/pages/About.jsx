          Aykhan Aliyev is a Baku-born chef known for pairing refined technique with fearless creativity.
          He began his culinary journey as the owner of a successful poké bowl restaurant in Baku, but soon set his sights beyond fast-casual dining.
          His desire to deepen his craft led him to France, where he studied gastronomy at the prestigious <strong>Gastronomicom</strong> culinary school in Adge.

        <p>
          After completing his training, Aykhan joined the kitchen team at <strong>La Ferme Chapouton</strong>,
          a Michelin Bib Gourmand restaurant in Grignan, where he developed a sharper eye for seasonality,
          plating, and detail under the guidance of a seasoned brigade.
        </p>

        <p>
          He returned to Azerbaijan with a vision to blend his classical training with global influences.
          As the founding sous chef of <strong>Bitter Baku</strong>, he helped shape one of the city’s most sought-after restaurants—delivering a menu that rotates seasonally and walks the line between elevated bar food and fine dining.
        </p>

        <p>
          His culinary style draws on his international travels, a deep respect for French technique,
          and a love for bold, unexpected flavors. Whether in a bustling kitchen or designing a private dinner menu, Aykhan is always crafting food with intention, curiosity, and precision.
